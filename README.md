# SpectrAInet
Deep Learning model for Molecular Communication

## How to use simulation functions
To generate data to train SpectrAI, build a program using the functions provided in the simulation folder. The user should have a dataset of UV/Vis spectra to use for the mixtures.

## How to train the network
To train the network, it is as easy as importing the necessary functions in the modules encoding, network and input_output.
